This repository contains a hardware prefetcher based on a basic cache simulator written in C/C++. And simulated memory hierarchy is described as below:
- L1 Data Cache
  - 32KB Size
  - 2-way set associative
  - 16 byte line size
  - write-through
  - no-write-allocate
  - 1 cycle hit time
  - 10 entry write-buffer
- L2 Cache (data only)
  - 256KB Size
  - 8-way set associative
  - 32 bytes line size
  - write-back
  - write-allocate
  - 20 cycle access time (fully pipelined)
- Main Memory
  - 50 cycle access time (not pipelined)
  - accesses to main memory are held in a FIFO queue with 10 entries
  - L2 cache will no longer accept requests if the FIFO is full
