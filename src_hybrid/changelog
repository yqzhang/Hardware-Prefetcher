- Fixed bug where the simulator will hang in some benchmarks.

Version 1.5 (Dec 3, 2007):

end a CPU load request (sorry, but this fix often decreases performance).

D-cache erroneously.
- setStatus() in CPU class doesn't return anything so it is now declared
to return void.

desired CPU request were getting added to L2 queue after entering 
STALLED_L2 state.

- Added check in main.C to make sure all requests from the prefetcher are
labeled as loads.

- Fixed bug in readNextRequest() of CPU that marked all accesses as loads.
